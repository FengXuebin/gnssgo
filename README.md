# DESCRIPTION

The development branch for golang version of RTKLIB 2.4.3.

RTKLIB is an excellent tool for GNSS development and research. Golang became population in recent. According to requirement of project, I recoded RTKLIB with golang for almost one years.

Due to limitation of commit folder size, I didn't commit data files. If you want to test the project, you could download from RTKLIB.
